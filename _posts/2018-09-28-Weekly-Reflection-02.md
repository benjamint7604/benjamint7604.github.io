I like how the class is somewhat interactive and fun for all of the students in the school. The class is interesting and I like sitting with my table mates because I can easily converse with them and help them with some things they don't understand that I do understand.

In the class we are learning about how expressions work in code and order of operations as if it were in math and how you could relate it to coding in how the order of the code in computer science depends on how everything processes.

I am so far not having any sturggles or challenges so far. I am happy so now I no longer have to stay after class and ask questions or no longer have to spend extra time on things I don't exactly understand.
