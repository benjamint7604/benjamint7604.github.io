So this week we started again with a new flag project as I was assigned the flags with a choice of either Cuba or Pakistan. I decided to try recreating the flag of Pakistan and somewhat suceeded with my flag collage. We tried making an accurate flag with similar properties to the actual flag with placement of the minor details. My flag is traditionally around 4x6 and has a ratio of 2:3 dealing with the hoist to fly. The entire collage project wasn't bad at all, in fact it was somewhat relaxing to just chill out and do an interactive activity.

With this tehre were a lot of questions asked throughout the week. Throughout the week I found people asking about where to find information on the flag. In addition to where the dimensions could be and which scale factor should be used in my project. There were more things I could have done to improve my project that I should do next time, including planning ahead and having background knowledge. Also, if I precalculate the dimensions with the day that I missed I would have been more efficient than missing an entire day of work due to me retaking the midterm.
