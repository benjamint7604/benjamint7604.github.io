I have done many things over the course of the week which was fun but also slightly boring with the tedious note taking and talks about the subject. Not that there is anything wrong with that but it makes the class seem more about the notes and not the interaction and collaboration of ideas. Although this may be true I am happy to know we are doing a video game project. 

So far this week we have learned how to code simple functions in the language called "Racket". Not only have we learned about functions but also other structures and strings and how they create images. But without a certain order there is no way of the conputer knowing what one is trying to create. We have also learnt about tags in html files and more.

Happy to say I am having no trouble at all with my schoolwork or understanding anything.
