During the week we have worked on this website most likely previously mentioned named wescheme which interprets the markup language of racket enabling us students to create images within code of strings, subjects and other things. In this project we are supposed to create a flag with the markup language we have learned. So far I am doing the Philippine flag as to my parents nationality and heritage to represent my country, and I am doing great so far except for the image of the sun on the flag is giving me such a headache due to the number of things I have named and how I can't exactly get all the separate images to appear into one because there is too much code for me to see and interpret to figure out what is going wrong. Defining figures with the define expression is supposed to help you know where or what is being put without the need of having to look at the extended code for a long period of time. I did enjoy the Pair Programming which happened over the week because that extremely helped my skills in how to code the specific shapes where, how and why.
