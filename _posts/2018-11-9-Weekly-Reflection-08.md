This week we learned about structures of contracts, we also learned more about positions and data with the x and y axis. In addition to this we learned more about how to create posns with their specific function of (make-posn) and figured out how to put images or values into other images or values. We haven't exactly learned much all week and therefore there isn't much to talk about, besides how we learned some things about fast functions.
