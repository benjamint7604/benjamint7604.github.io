This week we learned about Function Definitions, and with these function definitions, we were reviewing the different codes and the differences between them. We first started with the old circles of evaluation, then translated to racket. Then afterward, we compared and contrasted the differnt values in the code lines. We were talking about how different codes are different based on the types of strings and numbers. Another thing reviewed is the design recipe. The design recipe is defining differnt functions with images generally in order to generalize the different sizes and strings. We went over the basis of contracts again, as we went over the different parts; the name, range, and domain. The differnt parts define what the function is, and what the computer recieves. The function applications of (big-star "purple") and (big-star 25 "gold") are two very functions due to the missing value of 25 and their string. We reviewed many differnt contracts matching with the function applications and ended up talking a little about the Abstraction Barrier, which is what we really don't need to care about...

As said before:

And thats all we really have done throughout the week and I feel like the lesson plan was productive and I have no problems with any of the concepts being learned in class so far.
