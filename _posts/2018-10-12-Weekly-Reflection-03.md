Over the course of the week we learnt about contracts within the coding language called "racket". This coding language is very confusing but also very uniqure because of how it works and how the coding langage interprets specific things and ignores different things. In addition, that wasn't the only thing we worked on over the week. Since we were off of school for Indiginous people day, we started the week on a Tuesday which started the week not only short but productive as we worked on our flag collage project. In addition, we continued coding differnt shapes and colors with racket. With this we learned a new technique used by professionals called peer programming which was eventful. I liked peer programming but there should be a way on how the typer/controller known as the driver doesn't always do the typing and the peer/partner known as the navigator can just take over if the driver can't see the big mistake or isn't listening to the options they give.

I feel like I didn't contribute to participation, but then again as a very shy student that doesn't like to be wrong a lot I take the precaution before I embarrass myself. Although this is true I work diligently and efficiently with my table mates. Even with this I don't have any problems with the class or anything in general because there aren't any challenges currently. As we work more on the whole Video game project mentioned weeks ago, I'm sure I will come across multiple challlenges.
