At the beginning of the week we took our Lower Academy Computer Science Midterm Exam. With this we reviewed multiple mastery skills. We reviewed Mastery Skill 1, 3, 5. With these mastery skills displayed throughout the test with different levels of questions allowed us to assess what skill level we would be at. There were many interesting questions throughout the test, and some are worthy to talk about. One that is worthy to talk about is question number 16. 

This question talks about how a person created a function to create green triangles and wanted to have the function take in a number and output that number as the pixel size. In the question we were required to figure out which of the few test cases would fit the function. This question helps review Mastery Skill 5 as designing functions and interpreting test causes. We need to analyze a function and interpret which of the test cases given would fit into the solving the problem. 

This is an interesting question as it makes you think and interpret the question by doing some form of trial in error where it tells you to take the examples and figure out which is correct or works properly. There are only two given answers that are examples which make the question slightly easy but answers C and D make the question somewhat confusing as it states if both of the above or none of the above fit into the function, this makes you think and forces you to interpret both to see if it would work. Considering that this question is multistep I would definitely classify this question as a Practitioner level question.

The data of how the people answered the question was almost above 75% of the class and tells us that a majority of the class can understand how to interpret test cases into functions and see a working result/outcome.
